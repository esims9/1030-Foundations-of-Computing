<h2>Bouldering in Utah</h2>

<div>
<p>Bouldering is a very popular sport in 
	<a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105708957/utah">Utah</a>. 
	It is similar to rock climbing,
	but there are no ropes. With only some chalk and your hands, the object is 
	to scale the rock. The routes for bouldering are much shorter than rock 
	climbing routes, but they are no less difficult. Utah is known for it's
	bouldering and rock climbing community. Multiple gyms and outdoor
	areas offer bouldering. Here is a list of popular outdoor

	needed are climbing shoes, an optional crash pad, chalk, and a chalk 
	bag to hold the chalk. The climbing shoes are specifically made to help 
	your feet to find purchase upon the rock wall. A chalk bag is used to keep 
	your hands dry from sweat so you don't slip when grabbing a hold. A crash 
	pad is placed beneath you as you climb upon a rock wall outside. If you
	find a climbing gym that has bouldering, the floor is one large crash pad
